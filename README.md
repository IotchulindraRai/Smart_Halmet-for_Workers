 # Introduction
 A smart helmet is a type of helmet that is equipped with technology such as sensors, cameras, or displays to enhance safety, communication,
 or entertainment. Smart helmets may have features such as built-in microphones and speakers for communication, heads-up displays for navigation 
 or performance data, or sensors that detect impacts or changes in the rider's environment. They are commonly used by motorcyclists, cyclists
 or skiers to increase safety and provide additional functionality. It is also called as life saver Helmet. A life saver helmet, also known as 
 an intelligent or smart safety helmet is a type of helmet that is designed to enhance the safety of the wearer in potentially dangerous environments, 
 such as construction sites or industrial settings. It is equipped with advanced sensors, communication systems, and other technologies to provide real-time
 monitoring of the wearer's health, location, and environment. In addition to improving safety, life saver helmets may also provide benefits such as
 improved efficiency and productivity, as they can help workers to quickly identify and respond to potential hazards. They can also provide valuable data for 
 analyzing workplace safety and making improvements to processes and equipment.
 
 # Objective
• To improve safety for the wearer, particularly in high-risk environments such as industrial or construction settings, or during motorcycle riding.

• To incorporate advanced technology such as GPS, sensors, and communication systems to detect accidents or other safety risks and to alert emergency services.

# Limitation
• Cost: Smart helmets may be more expensive than traditional helmets, which could be a barrier to their adoption in some settings.

• Reliability: The technology used in smart helmets may not always be 100% reliable, which could result in false positives or negatives

• User acceptance: Some workers may be resistant to the idea of wearing a smart helmet, particularly if it is uncomfortable or cumbersome.

• Maintenance: Smart helmets may require more maintenance than traditional helmets, which could add to the overall cost of the technology.

• Privacy concerns: Smart helmets collect and transmit data about the wearer's location, health, and other information, which could raise privacy concerns.




# Disadvantages

1	Cost: Smart helmets are typically more expensive than traditional helmets, which can make them less accessible to some people.
2	Reliance on technology: Smart helmets are dependent on technology, and if the technology fails, the helmet may not work correctly.
3	Battery life: Some smart helmets require frequent charging, which may not be convenient for some users.
4	Complexity: Smart helmets may be more complex to use and may require more training than traditional helmets.
5	Compatibility: Smart helmets may not be compatible with all devices, which can limit their usefulness.
6	Maintenance: Smart helmets may require more maintenance than traditional helmets, such as firmware updates and software upgrades.
7	Weight: Some smart helmets may be heavier than traditional helmets, which can be uncomfortable for some users.
8	Network: It might be difficult to find the GPS location in lack of Network.



# Hardware & software Requirements:
1.	Arduino Board / Esp8266
2.	Gas Sensor
3.	Temperature Sensor DS18B20
4.	Light Sensor
5.	Resistors: 10k, 120, 4.5k
6.	GPS Module
7.	 3 axis Accelerometer
8.	Arduino IDE
9.	Think Speak
10.	Rain sensor

# Purposed Methodology
The system enables real-time monitoring of industries from the control station. The transmitter device is placed on the worker's helmet and the receiver
device is placed on the monitoring station. Wireless Wi-Fi technology is used to transfer data from the work environment to the base station. The Wi-Fi 
communication network enables monitoring of the screen's working environment through the thing’s peak application. The transmitter unit consists of an air
quality sensor, a helmet removal sensor, and a temperature and humidity sensor. Air quality sensors monitor the levels of harmful gases such as LPG, methane 
and carbon monoxide.  The MQ7 air quality sensor is used to monitor methane, LPG and CO levels and the LM35 is used to monitor temperature. These are 
solid state sensors. The sensor detects a certain gas level and transmitted the real-time data to the Arduino microcontroller, the controller receives the data,
processes it and sends it to the monitoring station via Wi-Fi. Here think Speak is used to display the status of the Hamlet.  We had used 3 Axis accelerometer 
to make the positioning and falling detection of helmet. We also used rain sensor to detect rain and when detect rain it will automatically turn on servo motor.
 

# Scope of project
1	Safety Features: The smart helmet would be designed to improve the safety of workers in hazardous environments. This would include features such as sensors to detect and alert the wearer to potential dangers, cameras to provide real-time visibility of the work area, and communication systems to allow for immediate response to emergencies. 
2	Health Monitoring: The smart helmet would be equipped with sensors to monitor the wearer's vital signs, such as heart rate and body temperature, to detect signs of heat exhaustion or other health issues.

3	Location Tracking: The smart helmet would include GPS tracking capabilities to monitor the location of workers in remote or dangerous environments. This could also include the ability to track the location of equipment or materials. 

4	Communication Systems: The smart helmet would allow for hands-free communication with other workers or supervisors, enabling workers to collaborate and coordinate tasks more efficiently. 

5	Data Collection and Analysis: The smart helmet would collect and analyse data on the worker's performance, such as movement and task completion time, to help optimize workflows and identify areas for improvement. 

6	Durability and Comfort: The smart helmet would be designed to withstand harsh environments and provide comfort to the wearer during long periods of use.
